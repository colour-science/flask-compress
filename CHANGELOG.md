## [1.7.0] - 2020-10-09
### Added
- The following parameters to control Brotli compression are now available: `COMPRESSION_BR_MODE`, `COMPRESSION_BR_LEVEL`, `COMPRESS_BR_WINDOW`, `COMPRESSION_BR_BLOCK`. [#10](https://github.com/colour-science/flask-compress/pull/10)
- Add deflate support [#8](https://github.com/colour-science/flask-compress/pull/8), with `COMPRESSION_DEFLATE_LEVEL` to control compression level (default is `-1`)

### Changed
